## Project Description

- This project involves writing the transformer code without using the PyTorch library. The main purpose is to understand the code and the underlying concept.

## Project Specification

- Study linear algebra (Khan Academy)
- Understand the structure of the transformer (+ attention)
- Rewrite the code
    - First, without using the PyTorch Library
    - Second, using the PyTorch Library
      
## Project Setting

- Create a new conda environment
    - `conda create -n [your env] python=3.9`
    - `conda activate [your env]`
